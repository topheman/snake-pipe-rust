Not just yet another snake game in the terminal ðŸ˜‰.

This one follows the [unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) as:

- `snakepipe gamestate` accepts user inputs, calculates the state of the game and writes it to `stdout`
- `snakepipe render` reads the state of the game from `stdin` and renders it on the terminal
- `snakepipe throttle` reads a pre-recorded game from `stdin` and writes to `stdout` each tick so that `snakepipe render` can pick it up
- `snakepipe render-browser` spawns a server and sends `stdin` via server-sent events to a JavaScript renderer in your browser
- `snakepipe stream-sse` connects to the server spawned by `render-browser` and streams server-sent events back to the terminal
- `snakepipe socket-play` accepts gamestate from stdin and pushes it to a unix socket
- `snakepipe socket-watch` reads gamestate from a unix socket
- `snakepipe tcp-play` accepts gamestate from stdin and pushes it to a tcp socket
- `snakepipe tcp-watch` reads gamestate from a tcp socket
- `snakepipe pipeline <command>` prints out the most common pipelines (combinations of commands), so that you could directly `pbcopy`/paste them

That way:

- you could write your own version of the `gamestate` or `render` command in any programming language and make it work with mine
- it's a great exercise to handle stream serialization/deserialization in rust

## Motivation

I've already done [a few rust projects](http://labs.topheman.com) (with WebAssembly or [bevy](https://github.com/topheman/bevy-rust-wasm-experiments)), however, I wanted something that needs to deal directly with:

- I/O
- parsing
- parallelism
- async programming
- handling piping/stdin/stdout/signaling ...
- inter-process communication

## Install

Any OS - if you have Rust >= 1.75.0  - [How to install Rust (if you don't have it yet)](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

```sh
cargo install snakepipe
```

On MacOS, with Homebrew (ships with its own [shell completions](#shell-completions) for zsh, bash and fish)

```sh
brew install topheman/tap/snakepipe
```

Other OS: see [releases](https://github.com/topheman/snake-pipe-rust/releases).

## Usage

### Piping

#### ðŸŽ® Play in terminal

```sh
# basic usage
snakepipe gamestate|snakepipe render

# change the defaults
snakepipe gamestate --frame-duration 80 --width 70 --height 20 --snakepipe-length 15|snakepipe render

# call help on any of the commands
snakepipe --help
```

#### ðŸ“¼ You can even record and replay using basic piping

```sh
# record a game into a file using the builtin `tee` command utility
snakepipe gamestate|tee /tmp/snakepipe-output|snakepipe render

# replay the game you recorded
cat /tmp/snakepipe-output|snakepipe throttle|snakepipe render
```

#### ðŸ–¥ You can mirror your playing terminal into a server you can open in a browser

```sh
snakepipe gamestate|snakepipe render-browser|snakepipe render
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You'll be able to switch between renderers in your browser as you are playing in your terminal (thanks to server-sent events).

#### ðŸ–¼ You can mirror your playing terminal into another one, through http

Open two terminals:

```sh
# main terminal:
# - accepts user inputs
# - spawns an http server that streams stdin to server-sent events
# - renders the game to the terminal so you can play
snakepipe gamestate|snakepipe render-browser|snakepipe render
```

```sh
# mirroring terminal (not necessary the same device, only need to be on the same network):
# - connects to the http server and streams server-sent events to sdout
# - render the gamestate retrieved from the server
snakepipe stream-sse|snakepipe render
```

You could share your game accross your LAN!

### IPC (Inter-process communication)

#### TCP

Open two terminals. `snakepipe tcp-play` will expose a process that accepts tcp connections (on port 8050 by default). You can connect to it via [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) (the `nc` command), that will pipe the tcp stream output to stdout.

```sh
# main terminal
snakepipe gamestate|snakepipe tcp-play|snakepipe render
```

```sh
# mirroring terminal
nc localhost 8050|snakepipe render # with netcat
snakepipe tcp-watch|snakepipe render # or with snakepipe itself
```

#### Unix domain sockets

Open two terminals. `snakepipe socket-play` will expose a [unix domain socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) (by default on `/tmp/snakepipe.sock`). You can connect to it via [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) (the `nc` command), that will pipe the socket stream to stdout.

```sh
# main terminal
snakepipe gamestate|snakepipe socket-play|snakepipe render
```

```sh
# mirroring terminal
nc -U /tmp/snakepipe.sock|snakepipe render # with netcat
snakepipe socket-watch|snakepipe render # or with snakepipe itself
```

### Others

#### ðŸ“º You can also mirror your playing terminal into another one

You should prefer using IPC.

Open two terminals that will communicate via a file that will be `tail`ed and piped to `snakepipe render`

```sh
# mirroring terminal
cat /dev/null > /tmp/snakepipe-output && tail -f /tmp/snakepipe-output|snakepipe render
```

```sh
# main terminal
snakepipe gamestate|tee /tmp/snakepipe-output|snakepipe render
```

### ðŸ˜‰ And maybe you'll find other ways?...

## Shell completions

If you install `snakepipe` with Homebrew, it ships with its own completions for zsh, bash and fish and they will be installed without you having to do anything.

If you installed `snakepipe` manually, you can generate the completions files with the `snakepipe generate-completions` command.

## Using as a library

```sh
cargo add snakepipe # add it to your project
```

This crate is a cli, but it also exports a lib from where you can import a few utilities, such as `snakepipe::stream::parse_gamestate` - [direct link to docs.rs](https://docs.rs/snakepipe/latest/snakepipe/stream/fn.parse_gamestate.html):

```rust
use snakepipe::stream::{parse_gamestate, Game};

fn main() -> () {
    match parse_gamestate() {
        Ok(stream) => {
            println!(
                "Frame duration {}, Snake length {}, Level {}x{}",
                stream.options.frame_duration,
                stream.options.snake_length,
                stream.options.size.width,
                stream.options.size.height
            );
            for parsed_line in stream.lines {
                do_something(parsed_line);
            }
        }
        Err(e) => {
            println!("Error occurred while parsing stdin: \"{}\"", e);
        }
    }
}

fn do_something(parsed_line: Game) {
    println!("Snake head position {:?}", parsed_line.snake.head)
}
```

## Contributing

You can:

- Make an implementation of the actual `snakepipe render` command for the terminal in an other language than rust
- Make your own JavaScript renderer for the `snakepipe render-browser` command and ask for a PR to integrate it to the project

An Experimental/Partial nodejs implementation of this crate available at [topheman/snake-pipe-node](https://github.com/topheman/snake-pipe-node).
